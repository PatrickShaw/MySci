Carbon is a tetravalent (meaning it is has four electrons available to form covalent bonds), non-metal, responsible for materials such as graphite and diamond. It is also provides the backbone for all organic molecules. It is required in sucrose, also known as table sugar (C12H22O11), which is often used in many types of food.
